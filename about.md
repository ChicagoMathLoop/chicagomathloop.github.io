We are a community of amateurs, scholars, and professionals interested in the diverse study of mathematics. We are based out of Chicago, USA and have a [Meetup.com group](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Mathematics-Loop/) dedicated to our gatherings.

This is a community site, and your contributions are welcome! If you would like to add content to this website, fork the `develop` branch of [https://github.com/ChicagoMathLoop/chicagomathloop.github.io](https://github.com/ChicagoMathLoop/chicagomathloop.github.io) and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with your additions or changes. There are as few restrictions on contributions as possible, but there are a few basic etiquette guidelines you should understand.
